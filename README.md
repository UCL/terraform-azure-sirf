# terraform-azure-sirf

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2094079.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2094079)

This repo demonstrates how to build and install [SIRF](https://github.com/CCPPETMR/SIRF) on an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) VM using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). The VM is described in Terraform files (`.tf`). Terraform deploys a VM in the cloud and then copies and executes a bash script to perform the actual building of SIRF. 

An Azure account is required for deployment.

## [Install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

## [Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)

## Configure Terraform access to Azure
- Query your Azure account to get a list of subscription and tenant ID values:
```bash
az account show --query "{subscriptionId:id, tenantId:tenantId}"
```
- Note the `subscriptionId` and `tenantId` for future use.
- Set the environment variable `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` to the subscription ID returned by the `az account show` command. In Bash, this would be:
```bash
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your_subscription_id
```
- Create an Azure service prinicpal for Terraform to use:
```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}"
```
- Make a note of the `appId` and `password`

## Configure Terraform environment variables
- Copy `var_values.tfvars.example` to `var_values.tfvars`
- Edit `var_values.tfvars` such that `YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_HERE`, `YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE`,`YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE` and `YOUR_TENANT_ID_HERE` are replaced by your `subscriptionId`, `appId`, `password` and `tenantId` respectively.

## Running the Terraform script
- Initialise Terraform:
```shell
terraform init
```
- To preview the actions that Terraform will take, run:
```shell
terraform plan -var-file var_values.tfvars
```
- To run the script:
```shell 
terraform apply -var-file var_values.tfvars
```
- If this succeeded, a virtual machine will be running on Azure.
- Find the public IP address of the machine:
```shell
az vm show --resource-group <RESGROUP> --name <VMNAME> -d --query [publicIps] --o tsv
```
where `RESGROUP` is the value set for `vm_prefix` followed by `Group` (default: `sirfGroup`) and `VMNAME` is the `vm_prefix` value followed by `VM` (default: `sirfVM`).
- Make a note of the IP address.
- To access the machine via ssh:
```shell
ssh USERNAME@PUBLICIP
```
where `USERNAME` is the value set for `vm_username` (default: `sirfuser`) and `PUBLICIP` is the public IP address found with the previous command. The password for access to the virtual machine is the value of `vm_password` (default: `sirf%1`).

## Jupyter
Once built, a Jupyter notebook will be running. The URL can be accessed from a web browser:
```
https://<PUBLICIP>:<JUPPORT>
```
where `PUBLICIP` is the IP address found previously and `JUPPORT` is the Jupyter server port set by `vm_jupyter_port` (default: `9999`). The password for access to the notebook is controlled by the variable `vm_jupyter_pwd` (default: `virtual%1`).

## Removing the infrastructure
```shell
terraform destroy -var-file var_values.tfvars
```
To avoid incurring unexpected costs, it is highly recommended that you check the Azure web portal to ensure that all resources have successfully been destroyed.

## Troubleshooting
If you get an error related to `SkuNotAvailable`, try to display all available machine types and see if the chosen machine exists in the region:
```
az vm list-skus --output table
```
